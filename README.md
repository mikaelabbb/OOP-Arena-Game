Homework project

I added 1 Weapon class with 4 Inhereted from it Classes: Sword, Spear, Bow and Crossbow.
They have speial abilities (the bow has a 5% chance to insta kill lol, the other weapons have a small chance to do 50% or 75% more damage)
The new Heros I added are Archer and Druid. 
Archer can do CriticalHit - double damage, and Evade incoming attacks.
Druid can heal a portion of health after taking damage and Shapeshift to increase damage attack.
I also made it so that the weapons the Heros use are random every round!
